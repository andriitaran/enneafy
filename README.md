## PROBLEM

This app was made during 1-Day Sprint during my diploma program at BrainStation. We were tasked to make a website/web application using technologies we've learned so far - HTMl, CSS(Sass), Javascript, React, Node, Express and Web APIs.

## APP VIEWPORT :

Currently the app is setup for iPhone 8+ viewport(414x736 px), but could be easily adapted to other screen sizes. It will be always centered if you use a bigger viewport size.

## TECH STACK

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Express

Public API: Spotify | https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
